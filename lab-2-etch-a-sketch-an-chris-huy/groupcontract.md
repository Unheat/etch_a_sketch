### Collaborative Learning

#### How Can We Leverage Each Other's Strengths?
(Discuss your strengths and how you can use them to contribute to the project.)
Each team member will list their strengths below to help us understand how we can best contribute:

An Dang: [List strengths, e.g., “Strong Python skills, experience with data analysis”]
Huy Tran: [List strengths, e.g., “Detail-oriented, good at documentation and research”]
Kris Wei: [List strengths, e.g., “Great at debugging and efficient code structure”]
By recognizing our strengths, we’ll assign tasks that let us shine individually while contributing collectively to the project’s success.


#### How Can We Support Each Other in Areas We Find Challenging?
(Discuss potential challenges and how you can support each other.)
We’ll discuss any personal challenges or weaker areas that may affect our contributions, 
such as difficulty with specific Python modules or time management. For example, if a member struggles with time constraints, others can offer flexibility in deadlines or help with more complex coding tasks.


#### How Will We Ensure Both of Us are Actively Involved in All Aspects of the Project?
(Tip: Regular check-ins to discuss progress and learnings.)
We’ll hold regular check-ins to review each member’s progress and learnings.
We can set mini-deadlines for individual tasks, ensuring everyone has a role in each project phase.



### Project Timeline and Planning

To help us stay on track and distribute tasks efficiently, we have outlined our main goals and meeting schedules for the next two weeks here:

| Date       | Day       | Goal/Objective            | Meeting Agenda & Notes               |

 6th November   1           understand problem          understand the problem and set up pico
 7th November   2           write code                  finished the code, it worked
 8th November   3           review and write reflction   finished

## Conflict Resolution
- **Seeking Help**: If we face issues in our collaboration, we will handle it as follows:
Seeking Help: If we face collaboration challenges, we’ll address them promptly, first discussing them as a group. If unresolved, we may consult our professor or teaching assistant for guidance.
Consultation with Professor: If issues arise that affect our project timeline or require mediation, we’ll communicate with the professor, aiming to resolve the matter professionally and quickly.

- We will follow the current steps to consult the professor to mediate if necessary before submission:

#### What Will We Do if Any Part of This Contract is Not Followed?
(For instance: have a conversation to understand the issue and find a solution.)
If any member fails to uphold this agreement, we’ll arrange a conversation to understand the cause and determine a fair resolution. Our priority is open communication and mutual support, but we’ll hold each other accountable for our responsibilities.

### Agreement

By agreeing to this, we commit to fostering a cooperative and enriching team experience.
